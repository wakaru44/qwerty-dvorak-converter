Qwerty-Dvorak Converter

A physical converter to forget about changing the layout in your operative system.

For the task I have chosen:

- Teensy 2

- Adafruit trellis

With the keypad from Adafruit (called Trellis), the idea is to be able to record keyboard macros easily, and allow switching more than one layout fast.

To use it, you will plug your regular USB keyboard in one side, and plug the case to your computer. You can change the layout using the buttons.
